<!-- Before I set my mind on breaking into the tech field my plan was
to go to medical school and become a doctor but
the medical class that I took my sophomore year of highschool had other
plans, I didn't find anything in that class interesting, I had taken a
computer science class my freshman year, and I liked it alot. Throughout
Highschool, I took Computer Science 1-3, AP computer science, Videogame
design, a Cisco Networking class, and computer programming
(in total 7 computer science related classes).
<br/><br/>
At Louisiana Tech I have taken classes such as Data Structures, Systems Programming,
Intro to Microprocessors, Computer Network Security, Applied Cryptography, and many more.
All of these classes have allowed me to grow my critical skill set, and I am ready to use
the skills that I have accumulated in a professional work environment.

I have experience in many languages, but the language that I am most comfortable with is
Python. Other languages that I have used include Java, C, C++, and JS. I am able to pickup languages
relatively quickly. I am currently learning Web development with the REACT framework along with VUE and MUI -->
